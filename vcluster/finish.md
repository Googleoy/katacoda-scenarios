# Congratulations!

You have successfully completed the vCluster scenario. You have learned how to:

1. Install the vCluster CLI.
2. Create and manage a virtual cluster within a namespace.
3. Create a pod inside the virtual cluster.
4. Expose the pod using a NodePort service.

You can now use these skills to work with virtual clusters in your own Kubernetes environments.

For more information and advanced usage, refer to the [vCluster documentation](https://www.vcluster.com/docs).
